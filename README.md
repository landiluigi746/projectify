> Your go-to solution for managing projects efficiently. Organize projects smarter, achieve results faster.

🚀 **projectify** is a smart and intuitive project management tool that helps you organize your work efficiently.

✅ Create projects, add tasks, and attach relevant links—all in one streamlined space.

📈 Stay on top of your workflow, track progress effortlessly, and bring your ideas to life with speed and precision.

## 🏗️ About the project

projectify is composed of three big parts:

- Database: PostgreSQL for storing project data and user information.
- Backend: a RESTful API server written in C++ that interacts with the database and manages project logic. Uses [Crow](https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow) as web framework and [taopq](https://github.com/taocpp/taopq) for database operations.
- Frontend-cli: written in C++ with [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI) in order to create an intuitive user interface on the command line. Uses [glaze](https://github.com/stephenberry/glaze) to handle JSON data and [cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) for HTTP requests.

**🌐 A web-based frontend is on the schedule. Stay tuned for updates!**

The database and the backend run on top of Docker containers based on PostgreSQL official image for the database and a lightweight Alpine image for the backend, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment.

Both backend and frontend-cli use CMake as build system.

## 🚀 Getting started

To get started with projectify, follow these steps:

1. 📥 Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/landiluigi746/projectify.git
cd projectify
```

2. ⚙️ Create a ```.env``` file with the variables required for the project:
```bash
# Backend config
PORT=8080
BUILD_TYPE=Release
REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=15
JWT_SECRET=secret_key
JWT_DURATION=3600 # seconds

# Database config
POSTGRES_USER=username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_DB=projectify-db
POSTGRES_HOST=projectify-db
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```

3. 🏗️ Build and start the Docker containers:
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

4. 🖥️ Compile and run the cli frontend:
```bash
cd frontend-cli
# if you want to build in a different build type, change this value
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
# if you want, you can use a parallel build 
# and specify the number of jobs to run in parallel
cmake --build build --target projectify-cli --parallel 4
./bin/projectify-cli
```
